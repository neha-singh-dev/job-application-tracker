# Job Application Tracker API

Backend system to track job applications built with Python and Flask.

## ⭐ Overview

This project helps you manage your job hunt in one place. You can:
- Add, view, update, or delete job applications
- Search and filter applications
- Track application status (applied, interviewing, etc.)

This backend is now being refactored into a RESTful API — the foundation for a production-ready job-tracker service.

## 🚀 Tech Stack

- Python  
- Flask  
- SQLite (basic)  
- (Soon) REST API endpoints  
- (Soon) Django + PostgreSQL

## 🚧 Features

- Full CRUD operations  
- Pagination support  
- Search & filter by role/company  
- Relational database design

## 📦 How To Run Locally

1. Clone the repo  
   `git clone https://github.com/neha-singh-dev/job-application-tracker.git`

2. Navigate into folder  
   `cd job-application-tracker`

3. Create virtual environment & install deps
   
4. Run the app  
`python app.py`

## 🛠 API Endpoints (Examples)

(Currently minimal — update after Django migration)
- `GET /jobs` – list all jobs
- `POST /jobs` – add job
- `GET /jobs/<id>` – get specific job
- `PUT /jobs/<id>` – update job
- `DELETE /jobs/<id>` – delete job

## 📈 Next Steps

- Complete transition to Flask REST API
- Implement authentication
- Move to Django + PostgreSQL
- Deployment (Heroku / Railway / Render)
